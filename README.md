# Spotify Song Popularity Prediction

This project aims to analyze a dataset of popular Spotify songs and build a model to predict the popularity of songs on Spotify.

## Data

The dataset used in this project is the "Popular_Spotify_Songs.csv" file, which contains information on 953 popular Spotify songs, including:

- Track name
- Artist(s) name
- Released year, month, and day
- Metrics like streams, playlist appearances, chart positions, and audio features like BPM, key, mode, danceability, energy, etc.

## Exploratory Data Analysis

The notebook explores the dataset in detail, including:

- Visualizing the distribution of song releases over time
- Identifying the artists with the most songs in the dataset
- Analyzing the top songs by various popularity metrics like playlist appearances and streams

## Modeling

The ultimate goal is to build a machine learning model that can predict the popularity of a song on Spotify, as measured by factors like streams and playlist appearances. The notebook explores different modeling approaches and evaluates their performance.

## Usage

To run the analysis, you will need to have the following Python packages installed:

- numpy
- pandas 
- seaborn
- matplotlib
- plotly
- wordcloud

You can then open the Jupyter Notebook file and run the cells to reproduce the analysis.

## Future Work

Some potential areas for future work on this project include:

- Incorporating additional data sources, like audio features or chart performance, to improve the predictive model
- Exploring more advanced modeling techniques, like deep learning
- Deploying the model as a web application or API to make predictions on new songs
